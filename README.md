# Kawasaki Ninja Upper Fairing Bolt Sleeve
Pertains specifically to the 2007 Ninja 250r, but also likely useful for 1988-2007 Ninjas of all engine sizes.
This project contains an open source 3D model of a plastic insert/sleeve in which a bolt sits. This bolt attaches the upper fairing to the gas tank. This model can be 3D printed in plastic in order to replace the missing or damaged OEM part.
